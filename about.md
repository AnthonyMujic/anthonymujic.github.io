I am a control systems engineer with 7 years of experience mining and water treatment. This blog is an attempt to document some of what I have learnt over the years. I still have a lot to learn, so if you see something you don't agree with, please let me know.

I do a lot of driving so I spend a few hours per week listening to podcasts. My favourites are [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/), [Ruby Rouges](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) and the [Ruby on Rails Podcast](http://5by5.tv/rubyonrails/).

My interests at the moment are [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and the [volt framework](http://voltframework.com/).

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
