I am a control systems engineer with 12 years of experience in mining and water treatment. This blog is an attempt to document some of what I have learn't over the years. I still have a lot to learn, so if you see something you don't agree with, please let me know.

My interest at the moment is [elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and its' ability to improve control systems development.

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) blog hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
